        <intro>
        	Combase data is usually stored in a semistructured spreadsheet file.
        	The CombaseReader reads in that file and stores its content in a
        	structured table. Each entry in a Combase file describes a single
        	growth/inactivation experiment. An experiment is characterized by time
        	series data, information about the environmental conditions and physical
        	parameters such as temperature, pH value or water activity.
