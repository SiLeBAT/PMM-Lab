        <intro>View and select primary estimations and the associated microbial data.</intro>
        
        
       <option name="Graph">Visualizes primary estimations and the associated microbial concentration over time.<br></br><br></br>
        <b>Mouse zoom:</b> To view a part of the graph in detail left click and simultaneously drag the mouse right and down. Another way is to use the zoom options in the context menu.<br></br><br></br>
        <b>Context Menu</b> (Right click in the graph):<br></br>
        <u>Properties:</u> Change font (type, size, color) and labels as well as the appearance of the graph.<br></br>
        <u>Copy:</u> Copies the graph to the clipboard enabling you to paste it in a graphical editor.<br></br>
        <u>Save as...:</u> Saves the graph as PNG (a bitmap image). Compared to the PNG image in the outport (which has a resolution of 640x480 pixels) this PNG is saved with the same size as on the screen.<br></br>
        <u>Save as...(SVG):</u> Saves the graph as SVG (a vector image). The file is saved with the same size as on the screen.<br></br>
        <u>Print:</u> Print the graph directly from Knime PMM-Lab.<br></br>
        <u>Zoom:</u> Zoom in and out or auto range the view for one or both axes.</option>
        
        <option name="Display Options">
        <u>Draw Lines:</u> Connect data points with lines which helps to distinguish between different sets of data.<br></br> 
        <u>Show Legend:</u> Display the model ID and the data set ID together with symbol and color.<br></br>
        <u>Add Info in Legend:</u> Adds the formula to the legend. This option is only available when the legend is displayed.<br></br>
        <u>Display Highlighted Row:</u> If checked, only the highlighted row in the table on the right is displayed. A comfortable way to select sets of data is to highlight a row and then navigate with the arrow keys (up/down). Using the keyboard, the space bar can be used to select/unselect a set of data.
        <u>Show Confidence Interval:</u> Computes and displays confidence intervals.</option>
        
        <option name="Range">Set the minimum and maximum values for the x and y axes.</option>
        
        <option name="Variables on Display"><u>X and Y:</u> Displays the heading of the displayed data column. Changing units automatically reformats the axes.<br></br>
        <u>Y Transform:</u> Transforms the data on the Y axis (square root, ln, log10, basis e, basis 10). This is useful if a display of data other than the PMM-Lab default (log10) is wished for (e.g. as actual cell counts -> 10^).</option>
        
        <option name="Filter">Filter the rows in the table to be displayed for model name, data ID and status.<br></br> 
        <u>'Model Name'</u> If several model formulas were used for fitting data, this option reduces the rows in the table to those containing the selected formula.<br></br> 
        <u>'DataID'</u> The DataID is an arbitrary negative number or shows the name of a ComBase dataset. In both cases the ID represents one dataset to which parameters of a primary model were fitted. This filter can be used to compare how well parameters of different model formulas could be fitted to the same dataset.<br></br> 
        <u>'Status'</u> Filters for different model estimation results. <i>Ok</i> = fitting successful; <i>No Covariance Matrix</i> = Confidence intervals cannot be calculated. Editing the expert settings in the Model Fitting node or choosing a different formula may help; <i>Coeff out of limit</i> = The fitting was successful, but only because the minimum/maximum values of the parameters given in the model formula were ignored; <i>Failed</i> = Fitting was not successful. Editing the expert settings in the Model Fitting node or choosing a different formula may help.</option>
        
        <option name="Columns">Click on <u>'Customize'</u> to select the columns to be displayed, e.g. model name, quality criteria (R<sup>2</sup>, AIC) and assay conditions (temperature, pH, a<sub>W</sub>).<br></br>
        <u>'Set optimal width'</u> changes the width of the columns such that the whole text is visible in each cell.</option>
        
        <option name="Table"> The table shows the available sets of data, whether they are currently being displayed (selected), the color and shape of the symbol and other information (see "Columns"). Clicking on a column header sorts the rows. To change the order of the columns drag the column headline. This is temporarily and not saved when the node dialog is closed.</option>
