        View and select primary estimations and the associated microbial data
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>View and select primary estimations and the associated microbial data.</intro>
        
        
       <option name="Graph">Visualizes primary estimations and the associated microbial concentration (cfu/g) over time (h).<br></br><br></br>
        <b>Mouse zoom:</b> To view a part of the graph in detail left click and simultaneously drag the mouse right and down. Another way is to use the zoom options in the context menu.<br></br><br></br>
        <b>Context Menu</b> (Right click in the graph):<br></br>
        <u>Properties:</u> Change font (type, size, color) and labels as well as the appearance of the graph.<br></br>
        <u>Copy:</u> Copies the graph to the clipboard enabling you to paste it in a graphical editor.<br></br>
        <u>Save as...:</u> Saves the graph as PNG (a bitmap image). Compared to the PNG image in the outport (which has a resolution of 640x480 pixels) this PNG is saved with the same size as on the screen.<br></br>
        <u>Save as...(SVG):</u> Saves the graph as SVG (a vector image). The file is saved with the same size as on the screen.<br></br>
        <u>Print:</u> Print the graph directly from Knime PMM-Lab.<br></br>
        <u>Zoom:</u> Zoom in and out or auto range the view for one or both axes.</option>
        <option name="Display Options">
        <u>Draw Lines:</u> Connect data points with lines which helps to distinguish between different sets of data.<br></br> 
        <u>Show Legend:</u> Display the model ID and the data set ID together with symbol and color.<br></br>
        <u>Add Info in Legend:</u> Adds the formula to the legend. This option only available when the legend is displayed.<br></br>
        <u>Display Highlighted Row:</u> If checked, only the highlighted row in the table on the right is displayed. A comfortable way to select sets of data is to highlight a row and then navigate with the arrow keys (up/down). The space bar selects/unselects a set of data.</option>
        <option name="Range">Set the minimum and maximum values for the x and y axes.</option>
        <option name="Parameters"><u>X and Y:</u> Displays the heading of the displayed data column.<br></br>
        <u>Y Transform:</u> Transforms the data on the Y axis (square root, ln, log10, basis e, basis 10). This is useful if a display of data other than the PMM-Lab default (log10) is wished for (e.g. as actual cell counts -> 10^).</option>
        <option name="Select">Either select all sets of data, deselect chosen data sets or invert the current selection.</option>
        <option name="Filter">Filter the rows in the table to be displayed for model name, microbial data ID and model fitting.<br></br> 
        <u>'Yes'</u> means the model could be fitted to the microbial data set.<br></br> 
        <u>'Warning' (yellow)</u> says that to fitted the model to the data the given minimum or maximum value of the parameters had to be extended. If this is not an option (e.g. because it is biologically not sensible) check 'Enforce Limits' in the Model Fitting node.<br></br> 
        <u>'No' (red)</u> means that the model could not be fitted to the data.</option>
        <option name="Table"> The table shows the available sets of data, whether they are currently being displayed (selected), the color and shape of the symbol, the data set ID and the assay conditions temperature, pH and aw. It also shows two quality criteria: The root mean square and R<sup>2</sup>.</option>
        <option name="Info Box">Informs about assay conditions and model parameter values.<br></br>Data points: Click on <u>View</u> to find microbial data as numbers in a table. These can be highlighted and copied (Ctrl+C), for example to paste them in a spreadsheet.</option>
