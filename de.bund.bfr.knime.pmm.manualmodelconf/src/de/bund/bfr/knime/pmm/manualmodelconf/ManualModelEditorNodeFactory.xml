    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Edit primary and / or secondary model formulas, either simply the formula(s) and parameters or also already estimated models (e.g. from the literature).</intro>
        
        <option name="MODEL DEFINITION"></option>
        <option name="Model type">Define type of model: Primary, secondary or primary (secondary). The latter is a combination of one primary and one or more secondary models.</option>
        <option name="Formula from DB">Do not change to enter a completely new formula. It is also possible to choose a formula from the database and to change it.</option>
        <option name="Formula name">Enter a name for the new formula.</option>
        <option name="Formula">Enter the formula and click 'Apply'. Enter e.g. '2x' as '2*x', if '2' does not belong to the parameter name.</option>
        <option name="Parameter Definition">Define the independent parameter. If known, also enter value, standard error, minimum and maximum values for the parameter. If the option 'primary (secondary)' was chosen click on a parameter name in order to define the secondary model for this parameter.</option>
        <option name="Goodness of fit">If known from a previously estimated model (e.g. from the literature), enter values for R<sup>2</sup>, root mean square, Akaike information criterion or Bayesian information criterion.</option>
        <option name="Reference">Click 'New Reference', choose a reference from the internal database and click OK to link it to the edited formula.</option>
        <option name="MICROBIAL DATA">Enter details about the experimental conditions leading to the data for which the entered model was estimated.</option>
