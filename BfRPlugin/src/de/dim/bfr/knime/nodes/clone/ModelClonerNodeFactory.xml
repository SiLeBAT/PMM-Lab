    <shortDescription>
    	Creates a table based on the column names of another table.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	This node allows easy creation of tables based on
	already existing tables. The column specification
	of the existing table is copied to a new table,
	which contains no data so far. In the node's dialog
	the user can add data by hand.
	You can use this node as an alternative for quickly adding new rows into
	the database, e.g. in the "Literatur" table. You would then create one
	(or more) rows in this node's dialog, send the output table to a
	<i>Table Array Merger</i>, and the resulting table array to the
	<i>Database Array Writer</i>.
