    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	        The node ensures that filter operations on conditions
	        are also routed to related data. Filtering conditions 
	        requires this node to precede the <i>Load Related Data</i> node.
	        No configuration is required. The data itself will not
	        be manipulated.
