    <name>Table Array Splitter</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
 		Extracts one specified table from an array of data tables.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
                	The node allows to extract a single data table from
       		an array of data tables. The single table can be
       		selected in the node's dialog. Splitting a table off
       		an array is neither a deletion from the array nor
       		will it produce a copy of the selected table. Instead,
       		the splitting provides referential access to the table. 
       		Every manipulation of the single table will be present 
       		in the table array as well.

		You might want to extract the table with the forecasted values to view them in a table or in a graph.
