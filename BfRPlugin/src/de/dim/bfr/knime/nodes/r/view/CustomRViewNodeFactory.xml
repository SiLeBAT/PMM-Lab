        <intro>
	This node uses R code to plot a graph of data and / or models which are
	related to a single experiment. It can be used to inspect a set of
	models and find the model fitting best to the measured data. If you do
	not specify measured values (i.e. a table "Versuchsbedingungen" in the
	input table array), you will have to provide a minimum and maximum
	limit for the t-axis in the plot in the options dialog. You can enter
	integers or decimal values, where the decimal sign is a comma (',').
        </intro>
                
        <option name="Min x-Value">Define the minimum value of the x-axis, if no data is provided.</option>
        <option name="Max x-Value">Define the maximum value of the x-axis, if no data is provided.</option>

	The view window shows the generated plots. Each experiment will result
	in a graphic plot. You can switch between the plots for the different
	test conditions (“Versuchsbedingungen”) by clicking on the arrows next
	to the plot number indicator on the right hand side or by using the
	keyboard (UP and DOWN).
