		<intro>
			This node uses secondary models from the database to predict
			changes in growth rates due to temperature, pH and / or aw, depending
			on input settings.

		<inPort index="0" name="Input Port">
			A data table array which consists of the output of the properly
			configured <i>Load Related Data</i> node, merged via the
			<i>Table Array Merger</i> with a table of input values created by the
			<i>Table Creator</i> node (which is part of the basic KNIME installation, not this BfR
			plugin). The created table has to follow a special form, described in
			the plugin's manual.
		</inPort>
		<outPort index="0" name="Output Port">
			A table array consisting of only one
			table, which contains the
			user-specified input variables as well as
			the predicted values for
			each specified model. This table can be
			extracted with an appended
			<i>Table Array Splitter</i>
			node.
