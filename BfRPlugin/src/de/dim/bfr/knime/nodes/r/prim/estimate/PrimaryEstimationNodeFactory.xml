    <name>Primary Estimation</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
		Try to estimate all available primary models
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	        This node takes an adequately prepared table array as input and tries to 
	        fit all of the available primary models to the data. Due to the nature of 
	        the nonlinear least squares estimation process, not all of the available 
	        models can be fitted. The node returns only the estimated models who 
	        converged to reasonable results during the estimation process.

			A table array adequately prepared by the <i>Load Related Data</i> node. See its 
			documentation for details.

        <outPort index="0" name="Output Port">
	Table array consisting of the tables "GeschaetzteModelle" (estimated
	models), "GeschaetzteParameter" (estimated parameters) and
	"ParameterCovCor" (parameters about the quality of the estimated
	model). These are the newly generated data of estimated models which
	have to be written back to the database. The output port will most
	likely be forwarded to the <i>Database Array Writer</i> node.
