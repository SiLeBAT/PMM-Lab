    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	Establishes and opens a preconfigured connection to a database. 
        	The connection settings are taken from the information provided 
        	by the user in KNIME's preferences dialogue. Make sure you have 
        	filled in all necessary information. The node scans the data at 
        	the inport and checks whether the database contains a 
        	corresponding table or not. If a corresponding table exists, 
        	all data from the inport table will be written to the 
        	corresponding database table.
