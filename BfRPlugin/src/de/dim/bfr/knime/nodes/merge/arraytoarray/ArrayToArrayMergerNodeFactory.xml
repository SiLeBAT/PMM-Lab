    <shortDescription>
    	Merges arrays of data tables.

        <intro>
        	This node merges two arrays of data tables
        	into one array.

        <option name="Replace duplicate tables on inport one">
        	If the arrays from both input ports contain tables
        	with identical table names, this option defines
        	the merging approach. Check this option to overwrite 
        	all duplicates with data from the second input port. Leave the
        	option unchecked to avoid overwriting in the merging 
        	procedure.
