    <name>Table Filter</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
    	Filter specific rows of a data table.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	         The node allows to filter specific rows of a data table
	        by defining filter values in an empty table. Based on these
	        filter values the node can either include or exclude rows 
	        of a data table. Chaining multiple instances of this node
	        allows for complex selections.
	        
	        Using the empty table as a filter:
	        The values provided within one row are interpreted as AND 
	        conditions, therefore only the rows matching all conditions 
	        are filtered. The values provided in different rows but 
	        within one column are interpreted as OR conditions, therefore 
	        one matched condition is sufficient for data to get filtered. Choosing "exclude rows" corresponds to NOT conditions.
